# Snake-Game

This is just me trying to put what I've learned to use. Whenever I have free time I practice on this. As my knowledge grows I plan to add more features like different speeds, a classic mode where its blocky, a mode where movement isn't limited to moving along one axis at a time. 

## Current Issues

* Eating the food makes the snake longer only along the x axis

## To be added

* Speed setting
* Classic mode
* Mode where movement isn't limited to moving along one axis at a time
* Pause function
* An easy mode where walls wont kill you
* Color options
